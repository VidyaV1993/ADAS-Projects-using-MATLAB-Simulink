# ADAS Projects using MATLAB-Simulink

This repository includes various projects done using MATLAB-Simulink for Advanced Driver Assistant Systems (ADAS) applications.

Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) are groups of electronic technologies that assist drivers in driving and parking functions. Through a safe human-machine interface, ADAS increase car and road safety. ADAS use automated technology, such as sensors and cameras, to detect nearby obstacles or driver errors, and respond accordingly.

The following are the projects included in this repository:
* Vehicle Direction Detection
* Adaptive Cruise Control

The Simulink model has been created using the requirements provided, Simulink Data Dictionary has been created based on the model requirements, results has been tested against multiple scenarios and the code has been generated using the embedded coder app in Simulink.
